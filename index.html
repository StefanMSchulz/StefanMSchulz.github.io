            <p>I am a student who is currently pursuing his Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Bonn, Germany.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Throughout my studies I have focused on Artifical Intelligence and Machine Learning. Besides doing coursework I also worked as a tutor for multiple lectures and as a student research assistant. Some of the results from my work at university either as a student or research assistant as well as personal projects will be displayed on this website. If you are interested in learning some more about me and my projects or want to collaborate feel free to reach out and check my resume.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Some of the projects I am working on and have planned include: a publication on rotation and reflection-invariant physics informed neural networks for fluid dynamics, a Data Science project, a project involving Reinforcement Learning in the Carla Simulator as well as an app for interactive primitve-based plant reconstruction. Be thrilled!</p>

                    <p>A long overdue project to display the work that I have done in the past, the work I am doing right now and the work I am doing in the future. It was the first time I did some front-end development and I am happy with how it turned out! :)</p>

                    <h4>Deep Learning for Geoscience Data</h4>
                    <p>During my work as a student research assistant under PD Dr. Steinhage and Florian Huber I worked on partial convolutions applied to satellite data to infer missing temperature data. Our approach proved to outperform the current state-of-the-art methods by producing more accurate and complete temperature maps. You can check the publication at MDPI.</p>

                    <p>As part of the robotics team "NimbRo" at the University of Bonn I worked on building a new robot for the RoboCup 2022 in Bangkok, Thailand. I was the referee of our team this year and responsible for configuring all the motors in the new robot. As part of winning the RoboCup in the Adult-Size league we published a paper which you can check out.</p>
